As college English education is greatly emphasized with the rapid development of global communication, the defects that exist in the current educational system are open to more criticism. It is widely acknowledged that thorough reform of college English education should be under way. People ask for English reform mainly because of the inadequacy of college English education under the current system. On the one hand, many college English teachers underestimate the role interest plays in English learning and keep preaching in class. On the other hand, most Chinese students tend to rely on rote vocabulary memorizing, grammar, listening, speaking, reading, and writing from each other, and therefore their English is also broken in this way.
